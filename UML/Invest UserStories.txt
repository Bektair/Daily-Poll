Independent:
Split up into CRUD stories.
Can combine stories if they are dependent on eachother,
Or split them across a different dimension

Negotiable:
Stories are not contracts
Do not need to include all details, as it gives falls impressions of precision
Need flexibility so it can be adjusted how much of it is implemented

Valueable
Must be explained how it is valuable to a type of user(persona) or purchasers.

Estimable:
You should be able to estimate how long it takes to implement

Small:
Large stories are hard to estimate and plan as they don't fit into single sprints.
Usually compound stories that contain other smaller stories. 
This can be done by dividing between for example CRUD boundaries or data boundaries.   

Testable:
Must be able to demonstrate that story meets the product owners expectation.
Should be 90+% automated(even with using the humble pattern some manual testing of UI is often required). 

Example template:
“As a <role>, I want to <action> so that <benefit>.”
