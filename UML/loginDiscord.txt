Precondition: not logged in with discord account allready
Main scenario:
The user writes the address of the login page and gets redirected towards
the discord-login. They then type in their discord credentials, when accepted
the login servlet contacts the database to update your userinfo.
Then a token is stored in your session letting you go through the webfilter
and to the mainPage.

Alternative:
The user writes any address within the homepages domain, before it arrives
the webfilter reads the request and discovers you are not logged in. It will
redirect you to the login page. 

Note to self:
Should make sure load page redirects if allready logged in.
